Hello I'm Jon Vaughn
I have 7+ years professional software development. I run my own company now doing development on my own. I have experience with Ecommerce, wordpress, woocommerece, photoshop, indesign, and AI. I can program in HTML, CSS, javascript/jquery, and php/sql. I am a full stack developer who is also a great visual designer. 

I have created many sites and done much design work. Here is a short list of sites that I have created and done almost all of the graphical design. Please look them over.
